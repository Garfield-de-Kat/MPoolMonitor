v3.6
- Fixed the problem with the scroll bars being offscreen for multipool and scryptguild
- Fixed problem with it not remembering idle popups being turned off

v3.5
- Fixed a problem where a "N/A" return from Eligius for last block value would trigger an error
- Changed all message box errors to notification bar messages, as message boxes stop all processing until the user clicks something
- Made the annoying idle worker popup even more annoying by adding a regular PC beep to it (can disable via options)
- Added support for LTC Rabbit
- Fixed a problem with connection problems to Eligius not being handled and displayed properly
- A few misc internal bug fixes, mostly around error handling

v3.4
- Put the proper BTC balance field for Slush in the top right (thanks SA!)
- Fixed a problem with ScryptGuild throwing errors if your decimal setting is a comma ","
- Fixed the problem with "Show worker data" and "Show balance data" not being on by default for ScryptGuild
- Changed the one "average" entry for Eligius to be the 256 second entry instead of 3hr, as the average routine is also the one that feeds the "idle worker" logic

v3.3
- Did some visual rearranging, the pending BTC and NMC values are always in the top right beside the hash rate
- Removed the row selector from the grids, as it served no purpose and took up space
- Changed the app to be single instance, to prevent users from accidentally running it multiple times
- Added a notification the first time it's closed to the notification tray
- Fixed the hash rate indicators for Scryptguild.. was showing 1000x too high
- Added luck indicators to Eligius.  All but the "last 10 blocks luck" require DB stats to be enabled (and working)
- Added local idle worker alerts, in the form of a tooltip, an annoying popup, and/or email alerts (existing email functionality is unchanged)

v3.2
- added support for Eligius
- changed the minimum refresh period to 5 minutes
- added the BTC balance to the main screen for ScryptGuild when coin balances are enabled

v3.1
- more internal changes to make it easier to add more pools
- upgraded to v6.0r1 of the JSON.net library to handle a parsing error that could occur with p2pool
- added support for ScryptGuild
- fixed a problem with BTC Guild payout info not being properly recorded to the database
- added a "bad" column to the worker listing for BTC Guild indicating the percentage of non valid shares

v3.0
- added support for blockchain.info stats
- lots of internal changes to make it easier to add more pools
- fixed a minor problem with a parsing routine for Eclipse

v2.9
- fixed problem with it not autostarting when BTCGuild is only one enabled
- 50btc works again.  apparently the API radically changed since I originally added support
- removed the popup on new block found option.  it was only enabled for some pools, and no one seemed to notice, so I assume it's not used.
- fixed problem with btcguild hash rate not showing on the tooltip icon
- fixed problem with slush hash rate not showing on the tooltip icon
- added support for multipool
- fixed problem with BTCGuild hashrate showing 1000 times smaller than it is
- added a Scrypt total hashrate separate from SHA256 total hashrate
- added a checkbox to the p2pool config to indicate it's a Scrypt pool instead of a SHA256 pool
- added the pending namecoin (NMC) stat to the BTCGuild output
